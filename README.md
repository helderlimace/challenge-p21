## Challenge P21

### Instalation
Assuming you already have the database service running, make a copy or rename ".env.example" file to ".env" and configure some variables before.

```
composer install
```

If you want a basic example ACL run:
```
php artisan migrate
```


If you want a clean database run:
```
php artisan migrate
```

To compile Vue
```
npm install
npm run watch
```

### Run the Project
```
php artisan serve
```
